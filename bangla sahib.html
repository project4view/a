<h1> Introduction of Lotus Temple </h1>
<article>
<P><font color="brown" size="5">Lotus Temple is located on the top of the Kalkaji hill in the South Delhi. This temple has been classified as the 'Taj Mahal of the 21st century.' This temple was built in 1980-81. This temple is one of the most recent Baha'i temple in India and joins six other Bahai temples around the world.

This temple is built out of white marble and in the shape of a half opened lotus flower. This temple looks similar to Sydney Opera House. This temple is visited by more than 50 million people, which makes it the most visited place in the world.

This temple was open to public in December 1986. It is a very wonderful building of simple design. This temple is the Asian headquarters of the Bahai faith.</font></p>

<h1> IStructure of Lotus Temple </h1>
<article>
<p><font color="brown" size="5"> This unique lotus shaped marvel in marble is enclosed by a landscaped garden and is a symbol of peace. To built this temple several traditional Indian means of construction were employed together with the most contemporary Western engineering designs and patterns. Fariborz Sahba, Canadian architect of Iranian origin in collaboration with a team of about 800 technicians, engineers, artisans and workers built this complex structure.

The building of the temple is enclosed by 45 lotus petals form the walls and 9 pools. This temple is made of cement, marble, sand and dolomite. The temple is 34 m from floor to apex, 70 m in diameter, with a seating capacity for 1300 worshippers. The nine pools on the elevated platform signify the green leaves of the lotus. These pools are not only a prominent characteristic of the temple but also keep the building cool. In the Bahai faith, the number nine represents unity.

The lotus shaped structure has two layers. One layer consists of the nine white marble-covered petals that point to heaven, and the other layer encompasses  nine petals that cover the gateways. There are no religious icons inside the temple, inside the temple there are only copies of the Holy Scriptures and wooden pews. By doing meditation and prayer in this temple, people develop their sense of discipline and strength of character.

The lotus flower indicate peace and purity, a symbol of the Manifestation of God, to the people of India. This ancient symbol has been given a contemporary and modern form in the structure of the Baha'i temple. This temple is a perfect place for meditation and to acquire tranquility and peace. Bahai faith consider that meditation and prayer are the two important instruments for the growth of the human soul, both in this world and the next.

The act of praying is described as 'Conversation with God' and meditation is recognized as the 'Key for opening the doors of mysteries'. The main aim of the Bahai Faith is to unite the hearts of the people and bring them closer to their Creator. The Bahai Faith believes in oneness of God, oneness of mankind and oneness of religions.</font></p>
