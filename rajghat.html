<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<article>
<P><font color="brown" size="5">The Raj Ghat in Delhi is a memorial dedicated to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. Originally the name of a ghat of Old Delhi on the banks of the river Yamuna, the memorial lay in close proximity to the 'Raj Ghat' on Yamuna River. With time, the memorial also came to be known as Raj Ghat.  </p>

<p>The Ghat is essentially a black marble platform that marks the spot of Mahatma Gandhi's cremation or Antim Sanskar on 31st January 1948, a day after he was assassinated. The memorial is uncovered, with an eternal flame that burns continuously at one end. The road on which it is located is also known officially as the Mahatma Gandhi Road. Once inside, a stone footpath bordered by lawns on each side leads to the enclosure that contains the memorial. A guest wishing to see the memorial must remove his shoes before entering inside.  </p></font>


<p><font color="brown" size="5"><P> The memorial bears the epitaph ‘He Ram’,<img src="pic\did\Rajghat\RT.png" width="30%" height="50%" align= "right"> literally translated meaning 'O' Ram', but also translated to 'O God', that are believed to be the last words uttered by Gandhi before he died. The memorial was designed by Vanu G. Bhuta, who intended it to reflect the simplicity of the Mahatma's life. The design has a black marble slab surrounded by red earth on all sides, as none of Gandhiji's ashram residences had any lawns. 


 With time, it has become normal for foreign dignitaries visiting India to pay homage to Gandhi by laying flowers on the platform as a sign of respect. A remembrance ceremony is held every Friday at Raj Ghat, besides the prayer sessions held at the Ghat on Gandhi's birth and death anniversaries.</p>

 <p>It is essential to know for all visiting this Memorial ground to ensure that you remove your shoes or footwear before entering the actual Memorial Site as a sign of respect to Gandhi Ji. Every Friday, you can attend a commemorative ceremony dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi Ji and also visit the prayer sessions organised on his birthday on 2nd October and during his death anniversary every year. You can also visit the two Museums including the National Gandhi Museum, dedicated to the life and works of Mahatma Gandhi Ji and the Nehru-Gandhi family.
